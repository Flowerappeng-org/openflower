# Purpose of this folder
This folder contains the reusable API methods for each application feature. Why do we have API functions? The idea is that we don't want to have repeat code as much as we possibly can. To reuse our code we put the code that is called over and over again into a function. The function is then referenced by other test cases code inside each `spec.ts` file. The `spec.ts` become the place where you create your system under test or SUT. The `spec.ts` become thinner and they contain the high level references (calls) to the test steps found in our Azure DevOps test cases. This will allow us
to scale to many test cases from 100's to 1000's of test cases. If we don't do this then our `spec.ts` files will contain the same code over and over. Additionally as the engineering team alters the application code with changes there will be less breaking changes to in the system under test. Example: If you have repeated code in five difference `spec.ts` files then you need to change five different `spec.ts` files, but if you use an reusable API function then you only have one change to the API function versus five changes in the `spec.ts` files. 

A great example of this is the login code that we can easily identify with as you would want to reuse the code that authenticates the user in all the different places that your test cases require you to login to the system. 
Another good example is the code to create a Model.
