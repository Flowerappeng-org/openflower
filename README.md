# About the Project

## Use OpenFlower in 3 steps
1. Connect to any data sources or APIs.
2. Build flexible and responsive UI with 100+ components and free layout / design possibilities.
3. Share with colleagues and customers.

# OpenFlower Value Proposition
One platform for everything instead so many different softwares. (like Website Builders, CMS, CRM, POS, ERP, Dashboards & Data Story Visualization, Collaboration Tools).

It's cumbersome to create a single app. You had to design user interfaces, write code in multiple languages and frameworks, and understand how all of that code works together.

NewGen Lowcode Platforms like Retool and others are great for their simplicity and flexibility - like OpenFlower too, but they can also be limited in different ways, especially when it comes to "external" applications for everyone.

OpenFlower is:
- An all-in-one IDE to create internal or customer-facing (external) apps.
- A place to create, build and share building blocks of web applications and whole websites.
- The tool and community to support your business, and lower the cost and time to develop interactive applications.
- The only platform to embed OpenFlower/Lowcoder Apps natively in Websites (no iFrame!)
- The only platform where you can build your own Meeting Tool - like Teams, Zoom or Google Meets, - just in the Lowcode way.
- The only platform which has extensibility plugin architecture
