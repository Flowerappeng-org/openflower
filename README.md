## Use OpenFlower in 3 steps

2. Build flexible and responsive UI with 100+ components and free layout / design possibilities.

# OpenFlower Value Proposition
One platform for everything instead so many different softwares. (like Website Builders, CMS, CRM, POS, ERP, Dashboards & Data Story Visualization, Collaboration Tools).

It's cumbersome to create a single app. You had to design user interfaces, write code in multiple languages and frameworks, and understand how all of that code works together.

OpenFlower is:
- An all-in-one IDE to create internal or customer-facing (external) apps.
- A place to create, build and share building blocks of web applications and whole websites.
- The tool and community to support your business, and lower the cost and time to develop interactive applications.
- The only platform to embed OpenFlower/Lowcoder Apps natively in Websites (no iFrame!)
- The only platform where you can build your own Meeting Tool - like Teams, Zoom or Google Meets, - just in the Lowcode way.
- The only platform which has extensibility plugin architecture
