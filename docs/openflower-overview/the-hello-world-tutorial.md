# The "Hello World" tutorial

1. At your first contact with OpenFlower you will see the Login Screen.&#x20;

If you haven't created your account yet, you can register a new account with the url /user/auth/register or the Sign up Link on the login page.&#x20;

When you create a User without Invite-Link, this User will automatically get the role of an Administrator with their own Workspace.

The first Screen of the Admin Panel of OpenFlower shows the overview of all Applications (in the current selected Workplace). For new Installations & logins, the Workplace is named by the email of the logged in User.

2. In OpenFlower you can create and find the building blocks of applications:

* Navigations
* Mobile Navigations
* Apps
* Modules
* Folder

All these building blocks are displayed on the home screen. \
You can order these building blocks by folders.

3. With the help of the blue "New" Button you can select and create a fresh, empty application. You will arrive at the App Editor Screen.

The main screen is divided into 4 sections. To create an Application typically starts to place any component from the red section to the application-space, yellow in the middle of the screen.

4. Components can get placed next to each other or through Layers, so components can visually overlap. 

The green area helps you to gather and prepare Data for your Application. Here data queries for multiple datasources as also data transformations and even javascript functions can get managed.

The blue area helps to see a hierarchical view of the components of an application as also to see in realtime their application state with current data and events.

The blue and red area consist of 2 panels between users can switch. (green marked areas)

In the blue section, general settings for an application can get managed, such as the applied theme, local Javascript and Style (CSS) embeds as also screen settings for expected resolutions.

In the red section, which opens automatically as soon as you click on a specific component in the application-space, all detail settings for the selected component can be made.

* Data Binding to show selected data with the component
* Event Bindings to take an user event and trigger an action
* Layout Settings to adjust positions for labels, orientation and visibility
* Style Settings to select colors, sizes and margins

5. As soon as you like, you can share an Application with selected users to test together.

Based on your settings you can invite special users only or make the application public accessible, so everyone can see the application. If you want to invite co-editors for your application, you need to give them the desired rights / role.

After all tests are done, your application is ready to hit the market. You can use the "Preview Button" to explore how your Application looks for a standard logged in user.

6. With the same button, but by help of the small arrow on the right, you can finally publish the application in it's current state. Make sure, the application is then accessible (Share menu) as you expect. (public or for selected users only)
