# Cloud & Private Cloud

OpenFlower is available online. You can start directly to build Applications.

[OpenFlower Playground - Start here](https://prod-us1.openflower.org)

We offer a hosted version of OpenFlower in this shared public cloud for free. We take care of updates, security, and scaling of the underlying infrastructure.

The public cloud has a central database for all users and applications. We suggest using the public cloud to get to know OpenFlower and make your first tests and Applications.

OpenFlower is hosted in Google data centers. Backups are organized every night for all infrastructure components and the Databases as Snapshots.
