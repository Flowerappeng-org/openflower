# Custom branding

Lowcoder provides a white-labelling feature that allows you to customize your workspace's **branding**, including logo, favicon, brand name and color. You can easily configure branding to match your company's branding and benefit from consistent experiences with your company's existing internal tools.

This feature is going to be removed and then replaced with a new extensible branding feature allowing you to add your own branding through extension points.
