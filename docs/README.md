# OpenFlower overview

## What is OpenFlower?

OpenFlower is an easy-to-use open-source low-code platform to build customer-facing, embeddable Saas applications within minutes.

Traditionally, building an application requires complex frontend and backend interactions with hundreds and thousands of lines of code, not to mention work on packaging, integration, and deployment. OpenFlower significantly reduces the work you need to do to build and publish an application.

In OpenFlower, all you need to do is drag and drop pre-built or self-customized components onto the What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) canvas, along with ready-to-connect databases and APIs, OpenFlower helps you build an app quickly and focus on business logic.
