# OpenFlower overview

### What is OpenFlower?

OpenFlower is a fork of Lowcoder. OpenFlower will provide an open-source fork of Lowcoder, a new product roadmap and will not contain 1) commercial references within the OpenFlower product software code and 2) will not contain commercial references within the documentation. Basically we won't to sell you anything and we don't want the software code to have commercial references or intentions. We will contribute product roadmap features upstream to Lowcoder code base and vice versa to stay up to date with the latest Lowcoder commits. Care will be taken to remove direct commercial features and will be replaced with extension points allowing users to implement their own changes without hard coded solutions directly in the Lowcoder code base.

## What is this platform?

Lowcoder is an easy-to-use open-source low-code platform to build customer-facing, internal and embeddable apps within minutes.

Traditionally, building an app requires complex frontend and backend interactions with hundreds and thousands of lines of code, not to mention work on packaging, integration, and deployment. Lowcoder significantly reduces the work you need to do to build and publish an app.

In Lowcoder, all you need to do is drag and drop pre-built or self-customized components onto the What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) canvas, along with ready-to-connect databases and APIs, Lowcoder helps you build an app quickly and focus on business logic.

## Why?

* **Open source:** For cloud and self-hosted deployment. Makes your ideas more feasible.
* **All-in-one platform:** Connection to all kinds of data sources and APIs such as Databases, Streaming sources, and Restful APIs, and ensures your data security.
* **Embed Apps everywhere:** Apps, that are created with Lowcoder can get embedded natively into Websites, Apps, and Mobile Apps.
* **High scalability:** The deployment options allow a single container image, but also a scalable multi-container deployment, so any kind of load is manageable.
* **Extensibility:** Add functionality in Lowcoder at multiple places. From simple custom components and external libraries to new data source plugins.
* **Clean design:** Follows the principles of [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) and supports display on screens of different sizes for Desktop and Mobile Applications.
* **Built-in features:** Multi-tenant management, Multi-workspaces management, theming, mobile screen, navigation support, fine-grained access control, and audit logs.

## How to build Apps?

Building an app [takes 5 steps](readme/the-hello-world-walk.md):

1. Quickly and securely connect to your data sources, including PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and online APIs.
2. Create Data queries visually or by SQL or set up request parameters to connect APIs.
3. Use our ready or self-customized UI components to build your app UI and bind and display query data with UI components like Tables, Charts, and Lists.
4. Set up event handlers to trigger queries, control components, or other actions in reaction to user interactions.
5. Preview and share your app with others.
